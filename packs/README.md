FleetKit ships with 5 battle-tested executive agents for free. Premium SOUL packs give you **specialized teams** for specific domains — deeply crafted, extensively tested, ready to deploy.

## What's In a Pack?

Each pack includes:

- **5 SOUL.md files** — Deep personalities with unique decision frameworks, communication styles, blind spots, and productive friction points
- **MEMORY.md templates** — Pre-populated with domain-specific context and frameworks
- **Workflow adaptations** — Modified brainstorm/standup protocols tuned for the domain
- **Example outputs** — Real brainstorm transcripts showing the pack in action

## How to Install

1. Purchase a pack
2. Download the zip
3. Extract into your `agents/` directory
4. Update `fleetkit.yaml` with the new agent configs
5. Run a brainstorm

## Why Premium?

The free agents took weeks of iteration to get right — testing hundreds of brainstorm combinations, tuning personality friction, eliminating generic responses. Premium packs get the same treatment for specialized domains.

The difference between a generic "VP Sales" prompt and a FleetKit SOUL.md is the difference between a cardboard cutout and a sparring partner.
