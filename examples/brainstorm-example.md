## Round 1: Opening Positions

### 💰 Hunter (CRO)

**Ranking:** #1 Digital Product Packs, #2 SaaS Platform, #3 Affiliate Model

- **Digital Packs**: Fastest path to $10K/mo. Developer market pays premium. Template packs = scalable digital goods with zero marginal cost. Revenue by week 4. $5-15K/mo potential.
- **SaaS Platform**: Recurring at $5/mo needs 2,000 users. Weak moat — larger competitors exist with deeper pockets. $3-6K/mo realistic ceiling.
- **Affiliate Model**: Other people's margins. $15 per transaction isn't recurring. $2-4K/mo max.
- **Verdict**: Focus everything on the digital product. It's the only idea that realistically hits $10K/mo in 6 months.

### 🔧 Forge (CTO)

**Ranking:** #1 Mobile App (fastest MVP), #2 Digital Packs, #3 Platform

- **Mobile App**: 3 days to working MVP. Simplest technically (2/10 complexity). Clear monetization path. Existing competitors have terrible UX — that's our gap.
- **Digital Packs**: Template-only scope, 5 days. Going enterprise is death by complexity (8/10).
- **Platform**: 4/10 complexity, 3-5 weeks. Feature creep risk is enormous.
- **Verdict**: Ship the mobile app this week. Test with real users. Scale what works. Then consider the rest.

### 📢 Echo (CMO)

**Ranking:** #1 Digital Packs, #2 Mobile App (rethink angle), SKIP SaaS

- **Digital Packs**: *This is our iPhone moment.* Every customer becomes an influencer. 9/10 viral potential. Community becomes a self-reinforcing flywheel — people collect packs like Pokémon cards.
- **SaaS**: 2/10 viral. "People don't evangelize utilities."
- **Mobile App**: Needs a bold positioning pivot. 6/10 viral with the right angle.
- **Verdict**: Digital packs. A transformation story beats a utility story every time.

## Round 2: Debate & Challenge

### 💰 Hunter (CRO)

> **Challenging Forge**: "Ship a mobile app in 3 days" — technically impressive, totally irrelevant. Speed to build ≠ speed to revenue. Where are the first 100 paying users coming from? You've solved engineering. You haven't solved distribution.

> **Agreeing with Echo** on viral potential of packs, **BUT**: "iPhone moment" is a metaphor, not a plan. What's the actual viral mechanism? Referral codes? Community showcase? Don't just say "viral" — engineer it.

> **Standing firm**: The digital product market is proven. Template creators make $10-50K/month. We go there.

### 🔧 Forge (CTO)

> **Challenging Hunter**: "Revenue by week 4" is aggressive bordering on delusional. Has Hunter actually mapped the funnel? Product → landing page → traffic → conversion → payment. That's 4 things that all need to work simultaneously. I've seen this movie before.

> **Challenging Echo**: The "iPhone moment" framing is inspiring and zero percent actionable. What are the deliverables? What's the technical scope? Convert the vision into a spec and I'll build it in a week. Until then, it's poetry.

> **Conceding**: Both Hunter and Echo rank packs #1. I'm convinced on the *market* — I was wrong to prioritize the mobile app. But the scope needs to be brutally minimal for v1.

### 📢 Echo (CMO)

> **Challenging Forge**: "Convert the vision into a spec" — sure, but don't pretend engineering precedes positioning. If we can't explain WHY someone should buy this in one sentence, no amount of technical excellence saves us. The spec starts with the story, not the other way around.

> **Challenging Hunter**: Agree on packs, disagree on approach. Hunter wants to "test with $100 ad spend." That's a conversion optimization mindset applied to a launch. We need a *moment* — Product Hunt, content marketing, community buzz. You don't A/B test a launch. You make people care.

> **Building on Forge's concession**: CTO is in. CRO is in. That's consensus. Now let's make it *remarkable*.

## Round 3: Synthesis

### 📊 Atlas (COO) — Executive Brief

## CONSENSUS
- **Kill the SaaS platform idea.** Unanimous — weak moat, high user acquisition cost.
- **Digital product packs have the highest ceiling.** All three rank it #1 or #2.
- **The mobile app is a distraction right now.** Even Forge conceded.

## KEY TENSIONS

| Question | Hunter (CRO) | Forge (CTO) | Echo (CMO) |
|---|---|---|---|
| What ships first? | Packs + store | MVP packs only | Packs + community |
| Launch strategy? | Paid ads + test | Just ship it | Big moment campaign |
| Timeline to revenue? | Week 4 | Week 6-8 | Month 2 (but bigger) |

## COO CHALLENGES
- **Hunter**: "Revenue by week 4" — I need to see the funnel mapped. Traffic source → landing → conversion. Where are the first 100 buyers coming from? Be specific.
- **Echo**: "iPhone moment" is compelling but unscoped. What does the launch week actually look like, hour by hour?
- **Forge**: "Brutally minimal v1" — agree in principle, but define what's IN and OUT. Scope ambiguity is how 5-day projects become 5-week projects.

## RECOMMENDATION: Ship Packs, Launch Bold

### Week 1-2: Build
- 5 curated product packs (templates, configs, workflow blueprints)
- Simple storefront (Gumroad or Lemon Squeezy)
- Price: $29-$79 per pack

### Week 3: Launch
- Product Hunt, Hacker News, relevant subreddits, social media
- Echo runs the content push
- Demo content: "Watch the product in action" recordings

### Week 4-6: Iterate
- Double down on what sells
- Introduce $19/mo subscription for pack updates + community
- Kill anything that isn't converting

### Revenue Target: 150-350 pack sales/month = $4K-$25K

## DECISIONS NEEDED
1. **Scope**: Which 5 packs ship in v1?
2. **Pricing**: $29 entry / $79 premium, or different structure?
3. **Launch channel**: Product Hunt first, or soft-launch to validate?
4. **Budget**: How much for launch marketing?
