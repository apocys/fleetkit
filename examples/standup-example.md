## 📊 Atlas (COO) — Synthesis

### 🔑 Key Highlights
- **Revenue growing 22% week-over-week** — $540 weekend sales without any marketing push
- **Product Hunt launch Wednesday** — all departments aligned and assets ready
- **Infrastructure cleared for 10x traffic** — CTO confirms system stability
- **Community growing organically** — 200 Discord members, strong signal for product-market fit

### 📋 Decisions Needed
1. **PH launch ad budget**: $200 for launch day ads — Hunter requests approval
2. **Tagline choice**: Bold ("Your AI team, ready on day one") vs. safe — Echo recommends bold
3. **Competitor response**: Their price increase opens a window. Adjust our positioning?

### 🎯 Atlas Recommends
Approve both: the $200 ad budget and the bold tagline. We have one shot at a PH launch — play to win, not to tie. On competitor pricing: hold our prices steady and emphasize value in launch messaging. Changing prices pre-launch adds unnecessary complexity.

**Cross-team action items:**
- CMO → CTO: Confirm live demo link by 2 PM today
- CRO → CMO: Approve final visuals by noon
- All: Final launch dress rehearsal tomorrow at 10 AM
