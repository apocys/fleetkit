# Decision Needed: Platform Strategy

**Date:** February 18, 2026  
**Urgency:** 🟡 Important (decide this week)  
**Raised by:** CTO  
**Prepared by:** COO  

## Context

During yesterday's brainstorm on Q1 priorities, fundamental disagreement emerged on platform strategy. CRO and CMO want mobile-first development for viral growth. CTO argues web-first for faster validation and lower complexity. The team is stuck and can't proceed with sprint planning.

## The Question

Should we prioritize mobile app development or web platform for our Q1 MVP launch?

## Options

### Option A: Mobile-First
- **Championed by:** CRO, CMO
- **What:** React Native app, iOS/Android simultaneously, web as secondary
- **Upside:** Higher engagement, viral sharing potential, modern user experience
- **Downside:** 3-5 week development timeline, app store approval risk, higher complexity
- **Cost:** $15K development, 5 weeks delay, app store fees

### Option B: Web-First
- **Championed by:** CTO
- **What:** Progressive web app, mobile-responsive, native apps in Q2
- **Upside:** 1-2 week development, instant deployment, easier iteration
- **Downside:** Lower engagement rates, limited sharing features, less "native" feel
- **Cost:** $5K development, 2 weeks timeline, hosting costs

## Agent Positions

| Agent | Position | Confidence | Key Argument |
|-------|----------|------------|-------------|
| CRO   | Mobile   | High       | "Mobile users pay 3x more, share 5x more" |
| CTO   | Web      | High       | "We need validation before complexity" |
| CMO   | Mobile   | Medium     | "Our audience expects mobile experiences" |
| COO   | Web      | Medium     | "Speed to market trumps perfection" |

## COO Recommendation

I recommend **Option B (Web-First)** because validation speed outweighs engagement optimization at this stage. We can build mobile-specific features (sharing, notifications) into the web app and transition to native when we have proven product-market fit.

The 3-week time difference gives us 3 more weeks of user feedback before committing to the complexity of native development.

## What We Need

Choose: Mobile-first or Web-first for Q1 MVP development

## Deadline

We need a decision by Friday to start Q1 sprint planning. Developers are blocked on architecture decisions until this is resolved.

**CEO Decision:** "Web-first. Forge is right — validate before optimizing. But Echo and Hunter, I want mobile sharing features built into the web version from day 1. No compromise on viral mechanics."
