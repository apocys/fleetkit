# Daily Standups

This directory contains daily standup reports generated by the FleetKit.

## Structure

One file per standup:

```
standups/
├── 2026-02-18.md
├── 2026-02-19.md
├── 2026-02-20.md
```

Standup files are automatically created when you run the daily standup protocol in `workflows/standup.md`.
