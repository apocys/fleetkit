# Contributing to FleetKit

First off — thank you. FleetKit is better because people like you show up.

## What We're Looking For

### 🧠 SOUL Packs (Most Wanted)

New agent personalities are the #1 way to contribute. A great SOUL.md file:

- Has a **distinct personality** — not a generic job description
- Includes a **decision framework** — how does this person think?
- Defines **communication style** — how do they talk, what annoys them?
- Creates **productive friction** with other agents

**Example:** A Chief Product Officer who clashes with the CRO on feature prioritization. A Head of Design who challenges the CTO on UX tradeoffs.

### 🔄 Workflows

New workflow protocols beyond brainstorm/standup/decision:
- Sprint planning
- Competitive analysis
- Customer interview debrief
- Quarterly planning

### 📊 Dashboard

The dashboard (`dashboard/index.html`) is intentionally simple. Contributions welcome:
- Charts and visualizations
- Real-time data integration
- Mobile responsiveness improvements

### 📝 Documentation

- Tutorials for specific use cases
- Translations
- Video walkthroughs

## How to Submit

1. **Fork** the repo
2. **Create a branch** — `feature/cpo-soul` or `workflow/sprint-planning`
3. **Make your changes** — quality over quantity
4. **Test it** — run your SOUL through a brainstorm, make sure it creates genuine friction
5. **Open a PR** — describe what you added and why

## Quality Bar

Every file in FleetKit should feel **crafted**. We'd rather have 5 exceptional SOUL files than 50 generic ones.

For SOUL.md files specifically:
- Read the existing ones first — match the depth and personality
- Include a "What Annoys You" section — this drives the best debates
- Give them a catchphrase or verbal tic — it makes output more distinctive
- Test with a brainstorm — if all agents agree, the personality needs more edge

## Code of Conduct

Be excellent to each other. That's the whole policy.

## Questions?

Open an issue with the `question` label. We're friendly.
